          <h1>What is MetabMaster?</h1>
          <p>MetabMaster is app for viewing and creating "pathway stories". These stories help you understand the pathways
            intuitively through a "show, don't tell" principle.</p>

          <p>The stories compose of an interactive pathway diagram and an interactive description. The interactive
            description contains links that, when clicked, will update the diagram to outline the information you're
          currently reading about. Parts of the diagram can be zoomed in on, panned to, highlighted, or hidden.</p>

          <p>MetabMaster is built using <a href="http://wikipathways.org" target="_blank">WikiPathways</a> for the pathway
            diagrams. Every pathway diagram is retrieved from the WikiPathways database.</p>

          <h1>Creating pathway stories</h1>
          <h2>Guiding principles</h2>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Create a "story"</strong>. The description must explain the pathway in a time-related manner.</li>
            <li><strong>Make it interactive.</strong> Include interactive links to show, in the diagram, what you're
            talking about in your story at particular points.</li>
            <li><strong>"Show, don't tell"</strong>. Use the diagram and the description together to "show" the reader what
              happens in the pathway.</li>
          </ul>
          <h2>Sign up</h2>
          <p>
            You need to have an account first so go ahead and <a [routerLink]="['/signup']">sign up here</a>. You must be
            signed in to create pathway stories.
          </p>
          <h2>Find a pathway in WikiPathways</h2>
          <p>You need to find the pathway you want to write a story for in
            <a href="http://wikipathways.org" target="_blank">WikiPathways</a>. You can use the search tool to find a
            pathway or create a new one. The
            <a href="http://www.wikipathways.org/index.php/Help:New_Contributor_Quickstart" target="_blank">
              contributor quickstart</a> has some useful tips on how to get started in WikiPathways.</p>
          <h2>Creating a new story</h2>
          <ol>
            <li>
              Go to the <a [routerLink]="['/pathway', 'create']">create page</a> to see the creation form.
            </li>
            <li>
              Grab the WikiPathways ID from your chosen WikiPathways pathway. This is the last part of the pathway's URL.
              For example, the URL for the TCA cycle is <i>http://www.wikipathways.org/index.php/Pathway:WP78</i>
              so the WikiPathways ID is <strong>78</strong>.
            </li>
            <li>
              Fill in the WikiPathways ID and you will see the pathway diagram load on the right.
            </li>
            <li>
              Fill in the title and description.
            </li>
            <li>
              Hit save and see your pathway story!
            </li>
          </ol>
          <h2>Making descriptions interactive</h2>
          <p>
            To create a description with interactive links, you must use the special Markdown syntax. A guide for creating
            the links is available <a href="https://jacobwindsor.github.io/kaavio-showdown/writers" target="_blank">
            here</a>. You can also use Markdown to create headings, tables, lists, etc.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>Remember!: </strong> each link is <i>"self describing"</i>. This means the diagram will be reset
            <i>before</i> performing the operations you specify.
